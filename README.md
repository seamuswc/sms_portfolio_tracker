## BUGS / NOTES

The program pulls its api data from www.coingecko.com.
Because of this, when enetering the coin name you must use the api token name provided by coingecko.

If you would like to add bitcoin, the api name is 'bitcoin'.
However for Synthetix it is 'havven'.

There is no error checking and wrong api tags will crash the program.
